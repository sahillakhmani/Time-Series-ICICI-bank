ICICI Bank Stock Price Forecasting Project
This repository contains a comprehensive time series analysis and forecasting project focused on ICICI Bank stock prices. We utilize advanced statistical models, including SARIMA and Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing, to analyze historical data, identify trends and seasonality, and build robust models for forecasting future stock prices.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of monthly closing prices of ICICI Bank, sourced from Yahoo Finance. The data covers the period from January 2012 to October 2024, providing a broad view of stock price performance over a decade.

Key Features:
Date: Monthly timestamps.
Close: Adjusted closing price of ICICI Bank stock.
Exploratory Data Analysis
Extensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) was conducted to identify key patterns:

Trend Analysis: Observed a long-term upward trend in the stock prices.
Seasonality Detection: Noted significant annual seasonality in the data.
Stationarity Check: Conducted the Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test and applied differencing to achieve stationarity.
Models Used
SARIMA (Seasonal ARIMA) Model:

Employed grid search to determine optimal model parameters.
Effectively captures both seasonal and non-seasonal components of the time series.
Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing:

Utilized a multiplicative trend and seasonality configuration.
Demonstrated strong performance in handling financial time series with multiplicative effects.
Results
Both models provided robust forecasts, with Holt-Winters Exponential Smoothing showing superior performance in capturing the multiplicative seasonality present in the data. The forecast results closely align with actual stock prices, making these models valuable tools for financial forecasting and investment decision-making.
